# Genome-Scale Algorithms
Algorithms that search patterns in sequences

## Algorithms

### search one pattern at a time
- Naive algorithm (search-naive.py)
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (search-kmp.py)

### search multiple patterns at a time
- Suffix tree (search-st.py)
  - Naive algorithm
  - McCreight's algorithm

## Running time
| Naive  | KMP  |  Suffix Tree |
|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |
